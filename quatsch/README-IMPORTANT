PLEASE

Don't use this compiler framework. While pretty performant thanks to heavy heavy
compiler time loop unrolling (thus leveraging away virtual overhead a bit) it is
also pretty unmaintainable as for exactly the latter. It also takes weeks to
recompile.

If you look at the quatsch2 branch, you'll see that rescue is coming, proll in
picogen 0.4.
