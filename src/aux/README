This folder contains some "sub-projects" of picogen which are too non-trivial
to be contained in the renderer/ directory.

* actuarius: header only serialization library
* kallisto:  header only math, crunch and PRNG library
* quatsch:   one-source-file-only functional scripting library
* quatsch2:  successor to quatsch (see git branch "quatsch2")
* xyto:      LSystem library
