picogen 0.3.beta
================================================================

There will be installer packages of picogen later, but this is a
bare release with binaries only, sorry for any inconvenience.

  * If you are a maintainer or want to port picogen to other 
    platforms:
      I would be glad to give you a hand on building picogen from
      source and with packaging.
