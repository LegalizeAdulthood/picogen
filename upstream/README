Files in this directory are only tracked in the "upstream" branch, any file you
put into this directory will be ignored by version control.

To checkout the upstream branch, do:

        git clone <picogen-repository>
        git checkout -b upstream remotes/origin/upstream

If the picogen repository layout changed at some day, you might want to look at

        git branch -a

If all not helps, beat phresnel via mail or in the forums.
